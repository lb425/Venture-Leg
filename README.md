Replacement Leg for Quanum Venture Quadcopter

I broke the legs on my Quanum Venture and foudn that the only way to get a replacement leg was to buy a new frame kit. So I did what any reasonable person who buys flying lawnmowers would do, I spent comparatively more in time to design, test, and revise a replacement leg.

The file Leg.stl contains the model for the latest version of the complete leg. As of now it is not a final design, and is expected to snap where the leg meets the base from large sideways forces.

The file base.stl contains a model of a base that will attach to the leg mounts. You can add your own leg design to the base.


Feedback is welcome.  If you use the legs and they break, put a picture in the issues and a description of what happened when they broke and I'll try to fix the model to make it more robust. Same goes for printing issues.

Also, let me know how well the leg or base printed for you. What online service did you use if you sent it out for print. If you printed it what slicer, printer, and material did you use?
